      <h1>About Jayson Scott Musson</h1>
      <p>Jayson Musson (born 1977 in the Bronx, NY) is an artist who mixes humor, pop culture, and real talk about the art world. He works in all kinds of media—videos, paintings, performances, and even puppets—to question what “art” really means and who gets to define it. He first blew up with his funny YouTube series ART THOUGHTZ, where he played Hennessy Youngman, a character who made art theory easy (and hilarious) to understand. More recently, his project His History of Art turned classic art history into a sitcom starring himself and a puppet named Ollie. Through his work, Musson keeps finding creative ways to make people laugh, think, and look at art from a new point of view.</p>
